// Move: all button reading and debouncing logic here (on/off, test mode, tap up/down, override). If you’ve added the rotary encoder, you can put the rotation/click reading here too.

// In .ino: remove direct digitalRead() for buttons; instead, call a single function (declared in input.h) that returns “events” (e.g., onOffPressed, testModePressed, etc.).

// Compile/test: press buttons and verify the same behavior as before.
